// This file will be removed. Provide empty content for deletion or ensure the build process handles file removal.
// For safety, I'm providing empty content. If the system expects a deletion instruction, that would be different.
// However, typically, providing empty content for a file path effectively clears it if overwriting.
// If the operation is to *delete* a file, the XML format might need a specific tag or attribute for that.
// Assuming for now that overwriting with empty content is acceptable, or that the file will be marked for deletion.
